How My Colour Replacement Maps Work:

Basically, the shader takes the main sprite, then uses the red value of each pixel to determine the coordinates to get colours from in the replacement map.

r value of 255 will always be white

Really annoying thing: texture coordinates start counting from 1, so the r values of the main sprites need to be increased by 1 more than you'd expect.

On the colour palette sprite, you can place 4 colours + white. That's all I've made space for (at least for Mega Man's sprites)
